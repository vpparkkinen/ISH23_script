Super basic simulations using the BoolNet package and the included mammalian cell cycle net that comes from [Fauré _et al._ (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btl210). The file `reduced_cellcycle` contains the updating rules, same as in the Fauré paper and `BoolNet::cellcycle`, but in disjunctive normal form.
